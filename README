python-bitzi

This is a straight python to c binding for bitzi's bitcollider using ctypes.

To install:

	python setup.py install

Next check out the "examples" directory to see some examples of using the
module.

If you use this in your project I would love to hear from you via email.


Rules for accessing the Bitzi site for bulk interactions (from
http://bitzi.com/bboard/message?message_id=187713&forum_id=4076#188140):

  (1) Identify your requests with a user-agent and version wherever possible,
  so that if your software does go haywire or overtaxes our service, we can
  contact you and adapt.

  (2) Only perform hits when they will clearly add displayed value to the
  user. A hit when a user consciously requests it (via a click or menupick) is
  always OK, dozens or hundreds of hits when they haven't requested such info
  are not. (If you want to do mass background lookups, please contact us so we
  can work out a way to enable it with minimal disruption.)

  (3) Respect HTTP error codes (like 503-server busy) and the 'retry-after'
  header for requesting a 'time-out' between requests. 

  (4) Include attribution to Bitzi when using/displaying Bitzi data, with a
  clickable link whenever possible.

AND

  (1) Only one request at a time

  (2) Pause between requests. A nice pause time would be the greater of either
  2 seconds or however long the last request took. (Then, if the server is
  bogging down and your requests are taking many seconds, you'd wait many
  seconds before trying again.)

  (3) If you get back any 5xx errors, slow down. Respect any 'retry-after'
  header that comes back asking for a delay before you retry.

  (4) If you just need to scrape it once, and doesn't matter to you the time
  of day, try to do it during our slow hours -- 12am to 5am pacific time.
