Description: python-bitzi is a wrapper around the Bitcollider library from Bitzi.  It
        allows you to extract metadata from different types of files.  Using this
        library you can get the bitprint (tiger tree + sha1), md5, song length, song
        bit rate, image dimensions.
        
        You can think of Bitzi as the "card catalog" for the heavenly jukebox,
        holding information about any and every media file that is ever reported to
        them, not just the files available on the web, or through any particular
        service, or through any particular sharing/distribution network.
        
        Developers of file sharing networks should find this extension useful.
